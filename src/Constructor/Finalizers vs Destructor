In Java, finalizers are associated with the process of garbage collection.
The garbage collector is responsible for automatically reclaiming memory occupied by objects that are no longer reachable in a program.
A finalizer in Java is a method that the garbage collector calls before it reclaims an object's memory to perform any necessary cleanup or resource release.

The finalize() method is used to define a finalizer for a class. It's declared in the Object class, so every class in Java has a finalize() method by default.
However, it's essential to note that using finalizers is generally discouraged and should be approached with caution.
There are some drawbacks and considerations when working with finalizers:

Here's an example of a class with a finalizer:

public class MyClass {
    // Some class members and methods

    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        try {
            // Cleanup code goes here
        } finally {
            super.finalize();
        }
    }
}

It's important to mention that starting from Java 9, the finalize() method has been deprecated,
and developers are encouraged to use the java.lang.ref. Cleaner API for resource cleanup.
The Cleaner API provides a more flexible and reliable way to perform cleanup operations without the drawbacks associated with traditional finalizers.
