# ArrayList in Java

## Overview
ArrayList in Java is a dynamic array implementation, offering advantages over traditional arrays. It provides flexibility,
automatic resizing, and built-in methods

ArrayList is a versatile and user-friendly alternative to arrays, offering dynamic sizing and a range of built-in methods.
Consider use cases and requirements to choose the most suitable option for your Java projects.

## Advantages over Arrays
### Dynamic Size:

- ArrayList: Automatically adjusts size during runtime.
- Array: Requires fixed size upon declaration.

### Ease of Use:

- ArrayList: Offers methods for easy manipulation.
- Array: Manual effort needed for resizing or manipulation.

### Automatic Resizing:

- ArrayList: Handles resizing automatically.
- Array: Manual resizing required.

### Built-in Methods:

- ArrayList: Provides methods like add, remove, etc.
- Array: Requires custom implementations.

### Type Safety:

- ArrayList: Supports generics for type safety.
- Array: No inherent type safety.

### Flexibility with Data Types:

- ArrayList: Stores objects of any data type.
- Array: Limited to a specific data type.

### Integration with Collections Framework:

ArrayList: Part of Java Collections Framework.
Array: Standalone data structure.

### Concurrent Modification:

ArrayList: Supports concurrent modification.
Array: Prone to ConcurrentModificationException.

### Null Elements:

- ArrayList: Allows storing null elements.
- Array: Can also store null elements.

### Enhanced for Loop:

- ArrayList: Compatible with enhanced for loops.
- Array: Requires manual indexing for iteration.
